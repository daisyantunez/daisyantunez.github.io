### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    I enjoyed doing Lab 05, part 1 because it was about "making a sandwich." For this lab, each input had different options to choose from, if it were wrong, it would state "error" or "your order" if it was right. I remember doing the std::string bread, protein, or condiment. Another reason why I enjoyed part 1 was because short, simple, and entertaining to complete.
