### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    I enjoyed doing Lab 05, part 1 because it was about "making a sandwich." For this lab, each input had different options to choose from, if it were wrong, it would state "error" or "your order" if it was right. I remember doing the std::string bread, protein, or condiment. Another reason why I enjoyed part 1 was because short, simple, and entertaining to complete.

* Lab 7

    Lab 07 part 2 was one of the most memorable labs that I remember for this class. It felt like I was making and playing a fun game. For this assignment, I learned how to use the bool data type better, and got the opportunity to input different letter combinations (Queen, King, 10, etc.)

* Lab 9

    Lab 09 part 1 was one of the more difficult labs to complete, but it allowed me to learn from my mistakes and go over past terms. I liked that it was themed on Olympic figure skating judging (finding the average in this case). For this lab, the inputs had to be three different numbers to receive an average. The statements used were double, for, if, and so on.
